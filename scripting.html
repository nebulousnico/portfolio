                <p>Intern Scripter (July 2025 – Present)</p>
                <p>- Developed server-client communication using RemoteEvents for player actions such as cuffing and
                    booking across the game.</p>

                <p>- Implemented security checks and restrictions to ensure only authorized players or teams could
                    perform arrests and bookings plus whitelisted teams (in terms of who can not be arrested).</p>

                <p>- Created a proximity-based door (with a model provided by the other team members) opening system
                    using ProximityPrompts so it opens when you click "E"</p>

                <p>- Added GUI pop-ups for arrest and booking procedures.</p>

                <p>- Worked on data logging features, including sending booking details to Discord via webhooks for
                    external record-keeping.</p>

                <p>- Got feedback and added it into scripts to prevent exploits and ensure reliable multiplayer
                    performance.</p>

                <p>- Designed and scripted a handcuff and booking system allowing players to arrest, handcuff, and book
                    suspects with interactive UI interfaces.</p>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <p> Scripter (May 2025 – July 2025)</p>
                <p>- Scripted interactive NPC behaviors, such as creating a morph (Chef) that attacks players when they
                    come near, including integrating attack animations to enhance player experience.</p>

                <p>- Implemented custom animations triggered by in-game events, like hit reactions for NPC attacks.</p>

                <p>- Collaborated with the team to create engaging gameplay mechanics through Lua scripting in Roblox
                    Studio.</p>

                <p>- Debugged and optimized scripts to ensure smooth and lag-free gameplay performance.</p>

                <p>- Integrated proximity detection systems to trigger NPC actions based on player location.</p>

                <p>- Created modular and reusable script components to speed up development across multiple projects.
                </p>

                <p>- Maintained and updated existing scripts based on feedback from other more experienced scripters and
                    gameplay testing to improve game balance and user experience. </p>

                <p>- Coordinated with other developers to integrate scripted features with UI elements and game logic.
